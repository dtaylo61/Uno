// Uno Card Game

// This is a computer console-based version of one of my favorite card games, Uno. This game consist of classes for a player’s hand, a card, the table, the deck, score, and a game.
// This program enforces the rules of the game and actually shuffles cards in an array before each deal, thereby making good use of System.Random. In addition, it supports multiple players and never deals the same card twice.
// In this game, the player is able to play against one or more computer opponents.  Over a period of time, other components may be implemented to make the computer a more challenging opponent by making it “smarter”.
